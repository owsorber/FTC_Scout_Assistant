# FTC_Scout_Assistant
This tool was built to help facilitate FTC competition scouting. After scouts input event information and match data, 
this system runs team performance analysis on the data, including calculation of statistics such as 
Offensive Power Rating (OPR) for each robot for ranking purposes. The Scout Assistant can help let your team know 
how well it is doing throughout the competition compared to other teams, and can provide information about 
potential alliance partners during alliance selection. Disclaimer: while the FTC Scout Assistant can serve as a 
useful scouting aid, you are encouraged to also use other means of scouting to understand less computable details 
such as autonomous compatibility, robot durability/mechanisms, specific robot capabilities, etc. This product is 
not affiliated with, associated with, authorized by, or endorsed by FIRSTÂ® Tech Challenge, and was built independently
by an FTC alum of team 6032 using the Django python-based web framework.
