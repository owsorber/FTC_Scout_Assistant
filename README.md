# FTC Scout Assistant
A web application developed with the Django python-based web framework by FTC Team 6032 alum, Owen Sorber.

## About
This web application is a tool built to help facilitate FTC competition scouting. After scouts input event information and match data, this system runs team performance analysis on the data, including calculation of statistics such as Offensive Power Rating (OPR) for each robot -- as well as common FTC statistics like RP and TBP -- for ranking purposes. The Scout Assistant can help let your team know how well your robot is doing throughout the competition compared to other teams, and can provide information about potential alliance partners during alliance selection. 

Disclaimer: while the FTC Scout Assistant can serve as a useful scouting aid, you are encouraged to also use other means of scouting to understand less computable details such as autonomous compatibility, robot durability/mechanisms, specific robot capabilities, etc. This application is not affiliated with or endorsed by [FIRSTÂ® Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc), and was built independently by an FTC alum of [Team 6032 Lightning Hawks](https://github.com/LightningHawks6032) using the Django python-based web framework.

###### This web application is based on my [FTC_OPR_Calculator](https://github.com/owsorber/FTC_OPR_Calculator) repository, which I originally created for the 2018-19 FTC Rover Ruckus season.
